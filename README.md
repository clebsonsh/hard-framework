# 🚧 Work in Progress 🚧

**This project is currently under active development.**

Features may be incomplete or subject to change.

**It is not recommended for production use.**

# 💻 Hard Framework

**Hard** is a lightweight, object-oriented framework written in pure PHP.
It focuses on simplicity, strict typing, and clean architecture principles (SOLID, KISS, DRY).

The goal of **Hard**? Peek behind the curtain of web frameworks, pull them apart, and see if I can make the magic happen
myself.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Strict typing across the entire codebase
* Simple `Router` with support for `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`
* Robust error handling for `404 Not Found` and `405 Method Not Allowed`
* Dynamic URL parameters (e.g., `/users/{id}`)
* Effortless Redirects
* Request and Response abstractions
* Contracts for request handlers

---

## 🔮 Coming soon

* Middleware
* Validation
* And more ...

## 🛠 Usage

### Defining Routes

Inside `app/Routes/web.php`:

```php
use App\Handlers\AboutHandler;
use App\Handlers\HomeHandler;
use Infra\Http\Router;

return function (Router $router) {
    // The handler is a class string, it will be lazy-loaded.
    $router->get('/', HomeHandler::class);

    // The handler is an instance, it is loaded immediately.
    $router->get('/about', new AboutHandler);
};
```

### Defining Routes with Parameters

You can define dynamic segments in your routes by wrapping a parameter name in curly braces `{}`. The router will
automatically extract the value from the URL.

```php
use App\Handlers\UserHandler;
use Infra\Http\Router;

return function (Router $router) {
    // This route will match URLs like /users/42 or /users/clebson
    $router->get('/users/{id}', new UserHandler);
};
```

### Defining Redirects

Easily create redirects with a specific HTTP status code.

```php
use Infra\Http\Router;

return function (Router $router) {
    // Redirects /old-url to /new-url with a 301 status code
    $router->redirect('/old-url', '/new-url', 301);
};
```

### Writing a Handler

All handlers implement `RequestHandlerInterface`. You can access route parameters from the `Request` object.

```php
namespace App\Handlers;

use Infra\Http\Request;
use Infra\Http\Response;
use Infra\Interfaces\RequestHandlerInterface;

class UserHandler implements RequestHandlerInterface
{
    public function handle(Request $request): Response
    {
        // Retrieve the 'id' parameter from the URL
        $userId = $request->getParam('id');

        return new Response::html("<p>Showing user: {$userId}<p>");
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Example Workflow

1. Define a handler in `app/Handlers`
2. Register it in a route file (`web.php` or `api.php`)
3. Run the server and visit the route

---

## 🧪 Testing

This project uses [Pest](https://pestphp.com/) for testing. The test suite provides 100% unit test coverage for the core
framework components in the `infra/` directory.

To run the entire test suite, use the following Composer script:

```bash
composer test
```

This will execute all tests located in the `tests/` directory.

---

## 🔬 Static Analysis

This project uses [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) for static analysis to find bugs before they reach production.

To run PHPStan, use the following Composer script:

```bash
composer lint
```

This will analyze the `app/` ,`infra/` and `public/` directories.
